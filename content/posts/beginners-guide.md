# So,

you've found yourself with a copy of that strange-looking book that's being talked about a lot on the internet. Or maybe you picked it up at a used-book store, intruiged by it's daunting cover. Or maybe you searched it up because of an obscure reference in a DOOM mod. Or maybe you found it on top of a paper-towel dispenser in an airport bathroom, just sitting there, ominously.

Whoever you are, the book you now hold in your hands, whether pristinely new or bursting at the seams, is ~~not~~ for you. House of Leaves tells a story like no other, but at the same time, recounts every story that's ever been told. It reaches into the deepest part of us, touching that deep, primal fear we didn't know we had. The fear of loss, of darkness, of passion, and most importantly, of love.

So enjoy your time within the House, navigating it's hallways, cracking it's codes, searching for meaning, as it's one you'll hardly forget.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## What edition should I get?

House of leaves has gone through many editions (see the [Editions Guide](#)), although only three are currently in print:

- Remastered Full-Color (paperback)
- Remastered Full-Color (hardcover)
- UK edition (paperback black and white)

It's suggested you get either of the full-color editions, as the colored text, artwork, and photographs add greatly to the reading experience.

## How do I read this thing?

How you experience House of Leaves is up to you. Some people read it as a traditional novel, page after page, while other's treat it like a labyrinth, following footnotes and exploring different sections of the book simultaneously.
House of Leaves may seem daunting, but you'll quickly learn how the book operates. Just start with the introduction, and make your way forward!

### Should I read all the footnotes?

Danielewski describes House of Leaves as a three-character play, with their narratives overlapping throughout the story.[^1]
The usual guidance is to read as if you were watching the novel's narrative play out visually.
So, yes, you should pay attention to the footnotes, but don't get so hung up on them that it hinders the flow of the book.

### Johnny's sections are obnoxious and gross. Do I really have to read them all?

How you read the book is up to you, although it's important to note that Johnny's character is gradually revealed over the course of the novel.
For some, as suggested by Danielewski himself,[^2] it might help to read The Whalestoe Letters[^3] before continuing The Navidson Record, in order to have a better understanding of Johnny's character.

## Why is "House" in blue? Why are some passages struck out in red?

One of the most common questions, and one Mark refuses to give us any lead on. Some questions you might ask yourself are:

- How does Danielewski associate certain colors with different characters?
- The blue House replicates a hyperlink. How does this connect with the time House of Leaves was published?
- Film and film analysis plays a large part in House of Leaves. In what ways does the House replicate a bluescreen, like one used on a movie set?
- In red letter edition bibles, the word of Christ is printed in red ink. In what ways does the color red relate biblically?
