        <h2>Welcome to The Pelican Project</h2>
        <p>Long ago, a man named Mark Z. Danielewski published a book called House of Leaves. The book's hauntingly revolutionary story spread from beyond its pages, and onto the internet. The Pelican Project consists of everything we can find related to House of Leaves and the Danielewski siblings. This site stands on the shoulders of projects such as Exploration Z and PolishChick.com, as well as the wider House of Leaves web.</p>
        <h2>I just got the book, what do I do?</h2>
