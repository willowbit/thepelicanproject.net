  <h2 id="what-edition-should-i-get">What edition should I get?</h2>
<p>House of leaves has gone through many editions (see the <a href="#">Editions Guide</a>), although only three are currently in print:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remastered Full-Color (paperback)</li>
<li>Remastered Full-Color (hardcover)</li>
<li>UK edition (paperback black and white)</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s suggested you get either of the full-color editions, as the colored text, artwork, and photographs add greatly to the reading experience.</p>
<h2 id="should-i-read-all-the-footnotes">Should I read all the footnotes?</h2>
<p>Danielewski describes House of Leaves as a three-character play,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> with them overlapping each other throughout the narrative.
The usual guidance is to read as if you were watching the novel&rsquo;s narrative play out visually.
Yes, you should pay attention to the footnotes, but don&rsquo;t get so hung up on them that it hinders the flow of the book.</p>
<h3 id="johnnys-sections-are-obnoxious-and-gross-do-i-really-have-to-read-them-all">Johnny&rsquo;s sections are obnoxious and gross. Do I really have to read them all?</h3>
<p>How you read the book is up to you, although it&rsquo;s important to note that Johnny&rsquo;s character is gradually revealed over the course of the novel.
For some, as suggested by Danielewski,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> it might help to read The Whalestoe Letters before continuing The Navidson Record, in order to have a better understanding of Johnny&rsquo;s character.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-house-in-blue-why-are-some-passages-struck-out-in-red">Why is &ldquo;House&rdquo; in blue? Why are some passages struck out in red?</h2>
<p>One of the most common questions, and one Mark refuses to give us any lead on. Some questions you might ask yourself are:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does Danielewski associate certain colors with different characters?</li>
<li>The blue House replicates a hyperlink. How does this connect with the time House of Leaves was published?</li>
<li>Film and film analysis plays a large part in House of Leaves. In what ways does the House replicate a bluescreen, like one used on a movie set?</li>
<li>In red letter edition bibles, the word of Christ is printed in red ink. In what ways does the color red relate biblically?</li>
</ul>

<p>MZD: There are many different ways to describe what is happening in House of Leaves, but I myself have always looked at it as being basically a three-character play. The footnotes just expanded the number of characters who could participate and interact with this main narrative.</p>

  <blockquote>
<p>MZD: My hope is that at least a few readers will read The Whalestoe Letters and then decide to move on to House of Leaves. Those who do will be more likely to feel some sympathy for and be more patient with Johnny because they have a greater understanding of his situation.</p>
