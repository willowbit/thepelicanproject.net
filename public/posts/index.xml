      <description>What edition should I get? House of leaves has gone through many editions (see the Editions Guide), although only three are currently in print:&#xA;Remastered Full-Color (paperback) Remastered Full-Color (hardcover) UK edition (paperback black and white) It&amp;rsquo;s suggested you get either of the full-color editions, as the colored text, artwork, and photographs add greatly to the reading experience.&#xA;Should I read all the footnotes? Danielewski describes House of Leaves as a three-character play,1 with them overlapping each other throughout the narrative.</description>
