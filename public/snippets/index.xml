      <description>MZD: There are many different ways to describe what is happening in House of Leaves, but I myself have always looked at it as being basically a three-character play. The footnotes just expanded the number of characters who could participate and interact with this main narrative.</description>

      <description>MZD: My hope is that at least a few readers will read The Whalestoe Letters and then decide to move on to House of Leaves. Those who do will be more likely to feel some sympathy for and be more patient with Johnny because they have a greater understanding of his situation.</description>
